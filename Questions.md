Homework Questions


1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a scripting language or programming language.

2. What can you use JavaScript for? Provide 4 examples of what JavaScript can do for you dynamically.

JavaScript is used to help make your web pages interactive. For example, when you have a search bar and able to type things and get a result from it.

3. What does DOM stand for?

DOM stands for, Document Object Model.

4. What is ECMAScript?

An ECMAScript is also a programming language like JavaScript.

5. How are single line comments created in a JavaScript file? Please provide an example.

A single line comment is created by using two forward slashes with text in between them.

Example:

```js
 // This is a single line comment //
 ```


6. How are multi-line comments created in a JavaScript file? Please provide an example.

To create multi-line comments you would use a forward slashe again with the asterisk and for the end or  closing you use the asterisk then the forward slashe. 

Example:

 ```js
 /* this is a multi-line comments example */
 ```

7. What method prints out a message to the Browser Console? Please provide a code example and a single line comment above the code example. Please also include what is returned in the console in your answer along with your code snippet.

The method used is the console log function. The code would look like this with single comment.

```js
// This is a single comment //

console.log("example"); 

```

8. What is the definition of arithmetic operators?

Arithmetic operators take the numerical vales and return a single numerical value.

9. What is a numerical value literal?

A numerical value literal is a number or an integer.

10. What is a numerical value variable?

This is also a number or integer that is stored as a value of a variable.

11. Which arithmetic operators does JavaScript support? List the arithmetic operators including their symbol, and please explain what each operator does.

It supports Addition operator:(+) which is used to add numbers.
Subtraction operator:(-) this is used to subtract numbers.
Multiplication operator:(*) this is used to mutiply numbers.
Division operator:(/) this is used to divide numbers.
Lastly is Modulo operator:(%) this is also used to divide, however it has a leftover or remainder number.

12. How many types of numbers are there in JavaScript? And how can they be written?

There are two types of numbers, they are double precision floating point numbers and BigInt numbers. They can be written as fractions, or with or without decimals.

13. What does BigInt make it possible to do when performing integer arithmetic?

It helps to represent whole numbers that are larger than 2(53) - 1.

14. What is integer overflow, and why does it occur?

Integer overflow is when the magnitude of a number exceeds the range that is allowed by the bit field.

15. What is a double precision floating point number?

This is a type of number that that can be represented as a fraction.

16. What is the sign of a number (referred to in the previous question)? And what built-in JavaScript method is used to find the sign of a number and how does it demonstrate this?

The sign of the number is represented as a fraction. This is following the IEEE 754 standard, and it is demonstrated by the arithmetic operators.

17. What is an integer?

A number that has no decimals or fraction. For example 100 is an integer.

18. What is an operand?

An operand is a string, variable, keyword, or object that is being typed that is also being returned.

19. What are two built-in methods that can be set on a JavaScript number to control the number of decimal places of a floating point number? Please define each method and provide code examples for each as well.

The toFixed() method which is used with the division operator and used to  obtained the number of decimals places and the toPrecision() method which is used for rounding the number to the nearest decimal place.

20. What are the differences between the toFixed() method and the toPrecision() method?

The differences are for toFixed() you can determine how many decimals places yu want to have. For the toPrecision() it is rounded by itself to the nearest decimal place.

21. What is operator precedence? Please provide an example with the solution to the calculation.

This determines how operators are parsed.
 Example:
```js
console.log(200 - 40 / 2 * 12 + 4)
```
The answer would be 36.


22. Consider the following arithmetic expression:

```js 
console.log(10 + 6 * 8 - 5)
```

What is the result of this arithmetic calculation? Please explain how you calculated this arithmetic expression using operator precedence.

The result is 53. first you would have to multiply 6 and 8. Then subtract by 5 and then add 10 to get the result.

23. Consider the following arithmetic expression:

```js
console.log(10 + 6 * (8 - 5))
```
What is the result of this arithmetic calculation? Please explain how you calculated this arithmetic expression using operator precedence.

The result would be 28 and first the 8 and 5 are subtracted then that is going to be multiplied by 6 and added to 10.

24. Consider the following arithmetic expression:

```js
console.log(20 - (10 / 2) * 3)
```

What is the result of this arithmetic calculation? Please explain how you calculated this arithmetic expression using operator precedence.

The result is going to be 5 and it is found by first dividing 10 and 2 then multiplying by 3. after subtract 20 to get the result.

25. Consider the following arithmetic expression:

```js
console.log(30 + (20 / 5) * 6)
```

What is the result of this arithmetic calculation? Please explain how you calculated this arithmetic expression using operator precedence.

The result for this is 54. And the way it would be calculated would be by first dividing 20 and 5. then it would multiply that by 6 then add 30.
